Citerra brings research writing into one focused environment.  
Students and researchers move between writing, literature search, citation management, PDF analysis, plagiarism checks, and AI support without switching tools or breaking flow.

The platform combines a dual-mode editor, a structured personal library, a real citation engine, advanced PDF interaction, and an academically aligned AI assistant.  
Everything is connected through the Citerra Cloud, where documents, sources, and context stay organized and consistent.

• Personal Library - Store sources, notes, and metadata in a structured, searchable system.  
• Citation Engine - Insert, track, and format citations with accurate bibliography generation.  
• PDF Workspace - Read, annotate, summarize, extract references, and ask questions about PDFs.  
• Plagiarism Check - Detect potential overlap before submission.  
• Academic AI Assistant - Help with clarity, structure, rewriting, and reasoning using only the user's document and sources.  
• Citerra Cloud - Sync documents and libraries across projects with consistent context.

## Citerra Platform

The Citerra Platform organizes the full academic workflow into a single, coherent system.

• Modular core - Writing, citations, library, search, PDF tools, and plagiarism checks all operate independently but work together.  
• Context model - AI operates within controlled document and library context to ensure accuracy and academic alignment.  
• Real-time sync - LaTeX and WYSIWYG updates, document versions, and metadata remain consistent across devices.  
• Document-centered design - Each document acts as its own workspace, holding structure, references, and AI context.  
• Secure cloud environment - Papers, sources, and metadata are stored safely within the Citerra Cloud.
