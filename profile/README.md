Citerra builds next-generation academic writing infrastructure.  
We develop cohesive tools that make research writing faster, clearer, and academically sound.

Our platform unifies writing, literature search, citation management, PDF interaction, plagiarism checking, and AI-assisted refinement into one focused workflow.  
Everything connects through the Citerra Cloud, where documents, sources, billing, and AI context are handled seamlessly.
